# Scheduler
This is a multielement desktop scheduler used for scheduling times to test code within a deparmtnet amongst other employees. 
Each user must login and are only allowed to reserve 3 slots for code testing purposes. These slots are in 3 hour increments. 
A user may only select slots for the current week and the following week(given next week's time to reserve slots has opened). 
Users who want a slot that is already taken will be put into a queue for that slot.
